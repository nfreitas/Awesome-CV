\begin{cvletter}
  I am an experienced academic researcher and I am now looking for new
  horizons in the productive sector. For this reason, it is my pleasure to contact
  you in order to enquire about the recent opening for a `Scientific Programmer'
  position.

  I obtained a PhD in Physics at the University of Buenos Aires in 2017,
  during which I focused on basic theoretical
  aspects of quantum and statistical physics, while I also explored more general
  interests by taking courses on neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and synthetic
  biology. In recent years I turned to a more applied line of research related to
  the energetics of electronic circuits and new information processing paradigms
  like probabilistic computing. I also had ample experience working in research
  labs, designing electronic circuits, and developing software.

  As part of my academic career, I had the opportunity to work in several countries
  and institutions, which allowed me to develop valuable skills related to team-working,
  teaching, and effective communication of scientific results. I am now holding a
  research position at the University of Luxembourg. However, I would like to
  transition from the academic to the productive/technological sector. I am
  eager to apply my knowledge and skills to technological or scientific problems
  with a direct impact on society.

  For the above reasons, I find Spire as an ideal place to develop my new career
  path. I feel attracted by the ambitious goals of the company as well as the many
  interesting technological challenges that ensue. As a highly motivated and
  independent person, I believe that Spire might provide the kind of dynamic
  and enriching environment in which I could develop my full potential.

  Finally, I hope that a profile like mine would be of interest to Spire, and I
  look forward to your feedback. I am confident I could contribute to diverse
  tasks like software development, mathematical modeling, data analysis and AI.
  I can be contacted at any time at the email and phone number provided above.
